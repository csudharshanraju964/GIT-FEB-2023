1.Call backs are not asynchronus by default.
2.Diff b/w async,await and Promises
     async&await                                                              Promises
1.they are expensive                                          1.they are not expensive
2.they will make non-blocking code to blocking                2.they are by default non-blocking
3.they will kind of make async code to synchronous code       3.they make code asynchronous
